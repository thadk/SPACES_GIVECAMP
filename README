Spaces App
----------

This app was written in 2 days at the Cleveland Givecamp http://clevelandgivecamp.org/

This is a charity event where developer and designers come together for a weekend to create software for non-profit organizations.

We had a great team work to build an iPhone app for SPACES Art Gallery in Cleveland. http://www.spacesgallery.org/
